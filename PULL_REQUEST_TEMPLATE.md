about: Making a Pull Request for the ZEIT Getting Started tutorial?

---

If you're making a pull request for a part of the tutorial on https://zeit.co to setup Github Integration, that's awesome! You're almost there ðŸŽ‰

Make sure of these 2 things before making the pull request:

1.  This Pull Request is against your own fork of the project and not the [zeit/now-github-starter](https://github.com/zeit/now-github-starter) repository. 
2.  Your Pull Request includes a `now.json` file with configuration settings. To get started, the file can even just contain `{}` and nothing else.
